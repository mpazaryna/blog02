I previously played rhythm guitar for The Black Hearted Angels, an Annapolis-based band that regularly played local spots and the occasional dive bar. We enjoyed the music, rehearsing regularly, crafting original songs, and covering classics like David Bowie's "Heroes" and Bobbie Gentry's "Ode to Billy Joe."

When I embarked on my yoga teacher training, I discovered surprising parallels between teaching and music. Both demand dedication, practice, and showmanship. Just as a well-curated setlist is crucial, a thoughtful yoga sequence is essential. You wouldn't play too many rockers in a row, nor would you repeat poses that might harm. Each yoga studio has its unique energy and audience, just like each music venue.

Over time, my approach to setlist preparation has evolved. I've still got my trusty binder, cherishing the handwritten process. I'll
scan the pages, create pdfs and save them off so I can access it easier through a device. 

I feel fortunate to have found fulfillment in both music and yoga. Playing music out and teaching yoga may seem worlds apart, but they share a common thread â€“ the joy of connection, community and rehearsal.
