## Pre-Development Stage

### 1. Problem Definition
- [ ] Use AI to brainstorm and refine the "problem to solve" statement
- [ ] Define the scope and objectives of the project
- [ ] Identify key stakeholders and users

### 2. Domain Exploration
- [ ] Leverage AI for research and analysis of the problem domain
- [ ] Use AI to identify existing solutions or similar projects
- [ ] Generate list of potential challenges and constraints with AI assistance
- [ ] Collaborate with AI to outline key features and requirements

### 3. Project Planning
- [ ] Determine if the project requires a UI frontend
- [ ] Assess backend requirements
- [ ] Consider if this fits into an existing "kit" or requires a new one
- [ ] Create a high-level project architecture with AI assistance
- [ ] Use AI to help define milestones and timeline
- [ ] Plan for early access and feedback collection

### 4. Technology Stack Selection
- [ ] Evaluate frontend framework/library options with AI insights
- [ ] Select UI component library or design system
- [ ] Choose backend technology based on project requirements and AI recommendations
- [ ] Decide on serverless options if applicable
- [ ] Select database technology if needed
- [ ] Configure AI development assistants for the project

## Development Stage
