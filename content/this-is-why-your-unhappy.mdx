## Put More Effort into Relationships

Are you making time to connect with family and friends. Are you nurturing relationships. Are you available

## Practice Self Care

How are you investing time into self care of your emotional health, your physical self, your overall relationship 
with the self and the Self. Taking time to be quiet and still.  

## Slow Down

Productivity is good, but how many to do and checklist items can you accomplish, is it leading to wellness? 
Busyness is not a badge of honor. Running on empty is not an option.

## Gratitude

With the pandemic, people realized they needed to be more grateful for what they have. The environment 
that you have is a great thing and being able to enjoy it is important. Stop and smell the roses.

## Be More Present

In the digital age all of this is so fast and moving towards distraction. We're either thinking of the 
future or the past or just stuck on the phone. Put the phone down and enjoy who you are with and where you are.

## Work Less

How much time is being spent at the workplace, if you're working nonstop what about the time necessary 
to connect to the inner space. To not overwork is a good thing.

## Continually Improve Oneself

Similar to self care, self healing through trauma, self esteem, confidence and how you heal. Develop skills and 
improve yourself through reading, therapy, new activities, be a student and keep learning and growing. Be a better person

## Prayer and Meditation

It's not just about being along, its about getting still through prayer and meditation. Develop your spiritual 
practice, the daily habit of meditation.

## Don't Be Careless

Prepare for things and be ready financially, invest and save, be mindful in your approach to "things"

## Humans Are Very Resilient

There is a ray of hope available, we are going to be fine and ok. We will get through this together. 
Take a breath, adjust, re-calibrate and get back.
